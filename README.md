# Meet

## Description 
In this Repository i will show up my learned skill on the "Testing in the Development Process" at [Carrerfoundry](https://careerfoundry.com). It consist of building a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

I'am currently using Node version 18.15.0 LTS.

git clone https://github.com/AlejandroBryan/meet.git


2- install all dependencies and devdependencies.

npm install 

3- run the application. 

npm start

npm run build

this command will create the `\build` file which our production ready code.

npm run deploy

it will take care of our deployment features.
